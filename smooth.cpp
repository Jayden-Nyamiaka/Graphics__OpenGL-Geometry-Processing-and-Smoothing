/* CS/CNS 171
 * Written by Kevin (Kevli) Li (Class of 2016)
 * Originally for Fall 2014
 *
 * This OpenGL demo code is supposed to introduce you to the OpenGL syntax and
 * to good coding practices when writing programs in OpenGL.
 *
 * The example syntax and code organization in this file should hopefully be
 * good references for you to write your own OpenGL code.
 *
 * The advantage of OpenGL is that it turns a lot of complicated procedures
 * (such as the lighting and shading computations in Assignment 2) into simple
 * calls to built-in library functions. OpenGL also provides an easy way to
 * make mouse and keyboard user interfaces, allowing you to make programs that
 * actually let you interact with the graphics instead of just generating
 * static images. OpenGL is in general a nice tool for when you want to make a
 * quick-and-dirty graphics program.
 *
 * Keep in mind that this demo code uses OpenGL 3.0. 3.0 is not the newest
 * version of OpenGL, but it is stable; and it contains all the necessary
 * functionality for this class. Most of the syntax in 3.0 carries over to
 * the newer versions, so you should still be able to use more modern OpenGL
 * without too much difficulty after this class. The main difference between
 * 3.0 and the newer versions is that 3.0 depends on glut, which has been
 * deprecated on Mac OS.
 *
 * This demo does not cover the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL for short).
 * GLSL will be covered in a future demo and assignment.
 *
 * Note that if you are looking at this code before having completed
 * Assignments 1 and 2, then you will probably have a hard time understanding
 * a lot of what is going on.
 *
 * The overall idea of what this program does is given on the
 * "System Recommendations and Installation Instructions" page of the class
 * website.

/* The following struct is used to represent objects.
 *
 * The main things to note here are the 'vertex_buffer' and 'normal_buffer'

 *
 * You will see later in the 'draw_objects' function that OpenGL requires
 * us to supply it all the faces that make up an object in one giant
 * "vertex array" before it can render the object. The faces are each specified
 * by the set of vertices that make up the face, and the giant "vertex array"
 * stores all these sets of vertices consecutively. Our "vertex_buffer" vector
 * below will be our "vertex array" for the object.
 *
 * As an example, let's say that we have a cube object. A cube has 6 faces,
 * each with 4 vertices. Each face is going to be represented by the 4 vertices
 * that make it up. We are going to put each of these 4-vertex-sets one by one
 * into 1 large array. This gives us an array of 36 vertices. e.g.:
 *
 * [face1vertex1, face1vertex2, face1vertex3, face1vertex4,
 *  face2vertex1, face2vertex2, face2vertex3, face2vertex4,
 *  face3vertex1, face3vertex2, face3vertex3, face3vertex4,

 *  face5vertex1, face5vertex2, face5vertex3, face5vertex4,
 *  face6vertex1, face6vertex2, face6vertex3, face6vertex4]
 *
 * This array of 36 vertices becomes our 'vertex_array'.
 *
 * While it may be obvious to us that some of the vertices in the array are
 * repeats, OpenGL has no way of knowing this. The redundancy is necessary
 * since OpenGL needs the vertices of every face to be explicitly given.
 *
 * The 'normal_buffer' stores all the normals corresponding to the vertices
 * in the 'vertex_buffer'. With the cube example, since the "vertex array"
 * has "36" vertices, the "normal array" also has "36" normals.

     * Recall that the 'init' function used the glMatrixMode function to put
     * OpenGL into a state where we can modify its Modelview Matrix. Also
     * recall that we want the Modelview Matrix to be the overall transform-
     * ation matrix that we apply to points in world space before applying the
     * perspective projection matrix. This means that we need to factor in all
     * the individual object transformations and the camera transformations
     * into the Modelview Matrix.
     *
     * To do so, our first step is to "reset" the Modelview Matrix by setting it
     * to the identity matrix:
     */

    /* Now, if you recall, for a given object, we want to FIRST multiply the
     * coordinates of its points by the translations, rotations, and scalings
     * applied to the object and THEN multiply by the inverse camera rotations
     * and translations.
     *
     * HOWEVER, OpenGL modifies the Modelview Matrix using POST-MULTIPLICATION.
     * This means that if were to specify to OpenGL a matrix modification 'A',
     * then letting the Modelview Matrix be 'M', OpenGL would perform the
     * following operation:
     *
     * M = M * A
     *
     * So, for instance, if the Modelview Matrix were initialized to the
     * identity matrix 'I' and we were to specify a translation 'T' followed by
     * a rotation 'R' followed by a scaling 'S' followed by the inverse camera
     * transform 'C', then the Modelview Matrix is modified in the following
     * order:
     * 
     * M = I * T * R * S * C
     * 
     * Then, when OpenGL applies the Modelview Matrix to a point 'p', we would
     * get the following multiplication:
     *
     * M * p = I * T * R * S * C * p
     *
     * ^ So the camera transformation ends up being applied first even though
     * it was specified last. This is not what we want. What we want is
     * something like this:
     *
     * M * p = C * T * R * S * I * p
     *
     * Hence, to correctly transform a point, we actually need to FIRST specify
     * the inverse camera rotations and translations and THEN specify the
     * translations, rotations, and scalings applied to an object.
     *
     * We start by specifying any camera rotations caused by the mouse. We do
     * so by using the 'glRotatef' function, which takes the following parameters
     * in the following order:
     * 
     * - float angle: rotation angle in DEGREES
     * - float x: x-component of rotation axis
     * - float y: y-component of rotation axis
     * - float z: z-component of rotation axis

     * to render something to display in the program window. Because your
     * computer is slow, OpenGL ends up rendering only part of the scene before
     * it displays it in the program window. The rest of the scene shows up a
     * second later. This effect is referred to as "flickering". You have most
     * likely experienced this sometime in your life when using a computer. It
     * is not the most visually appealing experience, right?
     *
     * To avoid the above situation, we need to tell OpenGL to display the
     * entire scene at once rather than rendering the scene one pixel at a
     * time. We do so by enabling "double buffering".
     * 
     * Basically, double buffering is a technique where rendering is done using
     * two pixel grids of RGB values. One pixel grid is designated as the
     * "active buffer" while the other is designated as the "off-screen buffer".
     * Rendering is done on the off-screen buffer while the active buffer is
     * being displayed. Once the scene is fully rendered on the off-screen buffer,
     * the two buffers switch places so that the off-screen buffer becomes the
     * new active buffer and gets displayed while the old active buffer becomes
     * the new off-screen buffer. This process allows scenes to be fully rendered
     * onto the screen at once, avoiding the flickering effect.
     * 
     * We actually enable double buffering in the 'main' function with the line:
     
       glutInitDisplayMode(GLUT_DOUBLE | GLUT_RGB | GLUT_DEPTH);
       
     * ^ 'GLUT_DOUBLE' tells OpenGL to use double buffering. The other two
     * parameters, 'GLUT_RGB' and 'GLUT_DEPTH', tell OpenGL to initialize the
     * RGB pixel grids and the depth buffer respectively.
     *
     * The following function, 'glutSwapBuffers', tells OpenGL to swap the
     * active and off-screen buffers.
